MODEL SPECIFICATION FILE
========================

This file is used to define a generalised linear model for daily climate
sequences. The row following this header is currently reserved for future
use. The next line can be used to define an overall description of the
model (which will appear in summary output files). Following this is a
row for every covariate in the model. Each of these rows looks something
like this:

COMPONENT       BETA    CODE1   CODE2   CODE3   TEXT

where:
        COMPONENT is    0 if we're defining the constant term in the model
                        1 if we're dealing with a main site effect
                        2 if we're dealing with a main 'year' effect
                        3 if we're dealing with a main 'month' effect
                        4 if we're dealing with previous days' rainfall
                        5 if we're defining 2-way interactions
                        6 if we're defining 3-way interactions
                        7 if we're defining nonlinear transformations
                        8 to define values of 'global'quantities
                        9 to specify a dispersion parameter
                       10 for spatial structure

                   and occupies positions 1-5 of the record

        BETA       is the coefficient for this covariate in the model,
                   occupying positions 6-15 of the record

        CODE1}     are used to define the covariates to the system.
        CODE2}     The interpretation varies depending on the value
        CODE3}     of COMPONENT: tables of codes can be found in the
                   program documentation. CODE1 occupies positions 16-20;
                   CODE2 occupies positions 21-25 and CODE3 occupies
                   positions 26-30. CODE2 and CODE3 are used only for
                   defining interactions.

        TEXT       contains descriptive text for this covariate, and
                   appears after position 31. It is not used by the program.

It is vital that this positioning is adhered to, for each record will
be read using the FORTRAN format I5,F10.6,3I5,A40.

This header is 46 lines long.
